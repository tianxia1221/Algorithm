# 202. Happy Number

> https://leetcode.com/problems/happy-number/

> Write an algorithm to determine if a number is "happy".
>
> A happy number is a number defined by the following process: Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits, and repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1. Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers.

## Approach 1 :  Common 

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isHappy(int n) {
        Set<Integer> set = new HashSet<>();
        
        int sum;
        int last;
        
        while(n != 1){
            set.add(n);
            sum = 0;
            while(n != 0) {
                last = n % 10;
                n /= 10;
                sum += last*last;
            }
            
            if(set.contains(sum)) return false;
            n = sum;
            
        }
        
        return true;
    }
}
```

## Approach 2 : Floyd Cycle Detection

```c
int digitSquareSum(int n) {
    int sum = 0, tmp;
    while (n) {
        tmp = n % 10;
        sum += tmp * tmp;
        n /= 10;
    }
    return sum;
}

bool isHappy(int n) {
    int slow, fast;
    slow = fast = n;
    do {
        slow = digitSquareSum(slow);
        fast = digitSquareSum(fast);
        fast = digitSquareSum(fast);
    } while(slow != fast);
    if (slow == 1) return 1;
    else return 0;
}
```
