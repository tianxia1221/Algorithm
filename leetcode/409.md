#  409. Longest Palindrome

> https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-palindrome/

> Given a string which consists of lowercase or uppercase letters, find the length of the longest palindromes that can be built with those letters.
>
> This is case sensitive, for example `"Aa"` is not considered a palindrome here.
>
> **Note:**
> Assume the length of given string will not exceed 1,010.

## Approach 1 : 

```c++
class Solution {
public:
   int longestPalindrome(string s) {
      int ans = 0;
      bool isSingle = false;
      vector<int> v(256, 0);
      int mask = ~1;
       
       for (auto i : s) ++v[i];
      
       for (int i = 0; i < 256; ++i) {
         if (v[i] & 1)
            isSingle = true;
         ans += v[i] & mask;
      }
       
      return ans + isSingle;
   }
};
