# 141. Linked List Cycle

> https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle/

> Given a linked list, determine if it has a cycle in it.
>
> To represent a cycle in the given linked list, we use an integer `pos` which represents the position (0-indexed) in the linked list where tail connects to. If `pos` is `-1`, then there is no cycle in the linked list.

## Approach 1 : 

```c
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * struct ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode *next;
 *     ListNode(int x) : val(x), next(NULL) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    bool hasCycle(ListNode *head) {
        ListNode *walker=head, *runner=head;
        if(!head) return false;
        
        while(runner->next && runner->next->next){
            walker = walker->next;
            runner = runner->next->next;
            if(walker == runner) return true;
        }
        
        return false;
    }
};
