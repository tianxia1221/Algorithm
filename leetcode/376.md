#  376. Wiggle Subsequence

> https://leetcode.com/problems/wiggle-subsequence/

> A sequence of numbers is called a **wiggle sequence** if the differences between successive numbers strictly alternate between positive and negative. The first difference (if one exists) may be either positive or negative. A sequence with fewer than two elements is trivially a wiggle sequence.
>
> For example, `[1,7,4,9,2,5]` is a wiggle sequence because the differences `(6,-3,5,-7,3)` are alternately positive and negative. In contrast, `[1,4,7,2,5]` and `[1,7,4,5,5]` are not wiggle sequences, the first because its first two differences are positive and the second because its last difference is zero.
>
> Given a sequence of integers, return the length of the longest subsequence that is a wiggle sequence. A subsequence is obtained by deleting some number of elements (eventually, also zero) from the original sequence, leaving the remaining elements in their original order.

## Approach 1 : State Transition

```c++
class Solution {

private:
	enum STATE {
		BEGIN,
		UP,
		DOWN
	};

public:
	int wiggleMaxLength(vector<int>& nums) {
		int size = nums.size();
		if (size < 2) return size;
		STATE state = BEGIN;
		int count = 1;
		for (int i = 1; i < nums.size(); i++) {
			if (nums[i] == nums[i - 1]) continue;
			switch (state) {
			case BEGIN:
				nums[i] > nums[i - 1] ? state = UP : state = DOWN;
				count++;
				break;
			case UP:
				if (nums[i] < nums[i - 1]) {
					state = DOWN;
					count++;
				}
				break;
			case DOWN:
				if (nums[i] > nums[i - 1]) {
					state = UP;
					count++;
				}
				break;
			}
		}

		return count;
	}
};

```c++
class Solution {
public:
	int wiggleMaxLength(vector<int>& nums) {
		int n = nums.size();
		if (n < 2) return n;

		// ensure the first sign
		int i = 1;
		for (; i < n; i++) {
			if (nums[i] != nums[i - 1])
				break;
		}
		if (i == n) return 1;

		int ans = 2;

		wiggleMaxLength(nums, i + 1, ans, nums[i] - nums[i - 1]);

		return ans;
	}

	void wiggleMaxLength(vector<int>& nums, int start, int &ans, int sign) {
		int n = nums.size();
		if (start == n) return;

		int curSign = nums[start] - nums[start - 1];
		if ((sign > 0 && curSign < 0) || sign < 0 && curSign > 0) {
			ans++;
			return wiggleMaxLength(nums, start + 1, ans, curSign);
		}
		return wiggleMaxLength(nums, start + 1, ans, sign);

	}
};
