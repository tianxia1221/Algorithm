#  174. Dungeon Game

> https://leetcode.com/problems/dungeon-game/

> The demons had captured the princess (**P**) and imprisoned her in the bottom-right corner of a dungeon. The dungeon consists of M x N rooms laid out in a 2D grid. Our valiant knight (**K**) was initially positioned in the top-left room and must fight his way through the dungeon to rescue the princess.
>
> The knight has an initial health point represented by a positive integer. If at any point his health point drops to 0 or below, he dies immediately.
>
> Some of the rooms are guarded by demons, so the knight loses health (*negative* integers) upon entering these rooms; other rooms are either empty (*0's*) or contain magic orbs that increase the knight's health (*positive* integers).
>
> In order to reach the princess as quickly as possible, the knight decides to move only rightward or downward in each step.
>
>  
>
> **Write a function to determine the knight's minimum initial health so that he is able to rescue the princess.**
>
> For example, given the dungeon below, the initial health of the knight must be at least **7** if he follows the optimal path `RIGHT-> RIGHT -> DOWN -> DOWN`.
>
> | -2 (K) | -3   | 3      |
> | ------ | ---- | ------ |
> | -5     | -10  | 1      |
> | 10     | 30   | -5 (P) |
>
>  
>
> **Note:**
>
> - The knight's health has no upper bound.
> - Any room can contain threats or power-ups, even the first room the knight enters and the bottom-right room where the princess is imprisoned.

## Approach 1 : 

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int calculateMinimumHP(vector<vector<int>>& dungeon) {
        if(dungeon.size() == 0 || dungeon[0].size() == 0) return 0;
        
        int row = dungeon.size() -1;
        int col = dungeon[0].size() -1;
        dungeon[row][col] = max(1, 1 - dungeon[row][col]);
        
        for(int i=row-1; i>=0; i--) {
            dungeon[i][col] = max(1, dungeon[i+1][col] - dungeon[i][col]);
        } 
        
        for(int j=col - 1; j>=0; j--) {
            dungeon[row][j] = max(1, dungeon[row][j+1] - dungeon[row][j]);
        }
        
        for(int i=row -1; i>=0; i--) {
            for(int j=col-1; j>=0; j--) {
                dungeon[i][j] = min(max(1, dungeon[i][j+1] - dungeon[i][j]), max(1, dungeon[i+1][j] - dungeon[i][j]));
                //dungeon[i][j] = max(1 , min(dungeon[i][j+1], dungeon[i+1][j]) - dungeon[i][j]);
            }
        }
        
        return dungeon[0][0];
    }
};
