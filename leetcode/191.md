# 191. Number of 1 Bits

> https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-1-bits/

> Write a function that takes an unsigned integer and return the number of '1' bits it has (also known as the [Hamming weight](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_weight)).

## Approach 1 : 

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int hammingWeight(uint32_t n) {
        int bits = 0;
        int mask = 1;
        for (int i = 0; i < 32; i++) {
            if ((n & mask) != 0) {
                bits++;
            }
           // cout<<bitset<sizeof(int)*8>(mask)<<endl; 	// 二进制输出
           if(i != 31) mask <<= 1; // runtime error: left shift of negative value -2147483648
        }
        return bits;
    }
};
```
>Runtime: 4 ms, faster than 66.78% of C++ online submissions for Number of 1 Bits.
>
>Memory Usage: 8.3 MB, less than 36.59% of C++ online submissions for Number of 1 Bits.

## Approach 2 : 

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int hammingWeight(uint32_t n) {
        int ret = 0;
        while(n>0) {
            n &= n - 1;
            ret++;
        }
        return ret;
    }
};
```

> Memory Usage: 8.4 MB, less than 9.76% of C++ online submissions for Number of 1 Bits.

## Approach 3 :

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int hammingWeight(uint32_t n) {
        n = (n & 0x55555555) + (n >>  1 & 0x55555555); // put count of each  2 bits into those  2 bits  0b01010101010101010101010101010101
        n = (n & 0x33333333) + (n >>  2 & 0x33333333); // put count of each  4 bits into those  4 bits  0b00110011001100110011001100110011
        n = (n & 0x0F0F0F0F) + (n >>  4 & 0x0F0F0F0F); // put count of each  8 bits into those  8 bits  0b00001111000011110000111100001111
        n = (n & 0x00FF00FF) + (n >>  8 & 0x00FF00FF); // put count of each 16 bits into those 16 bits  0b00000000111111110000000011111111
        n = (n & 0x0000FFFF) + (n >> 16 & 0x0000FFFF); // put count of each 32 bits into those 32 bits  0b00000000000000001111111111111111 
        return n;
    }
};

// This is a naive implementation, shown for comparison, and to help in understanding the better functions. 
// It uses 24 arithmetic operations (shift, add, and).
int hammingWeight(uint32_t n)
{
    n = (n & 0x55555555) + (n >>  1 & 0x55555555); // put count of each  2 bits into those  2 bits 
    n = (n & 0x33333333) + (n >>  2 & 0x33333333); // put count of each  4 bits into those  4 bits 
    n = (n & 0x0F0F0F0F) + (n >>  4 & 0x0F0F0F0F); // put count of each  8 bits into those  8 bits 
    n = (n & 0x00FF00FF) + (n >>  8 & 0x00FF00FF); // put count of each 16 bits into those 16 bits 
    n = (n & 0x0000FFFF) + (n >> 16 & 0x0000FFFF); // put count of each 32 bits into those 32 bits 
    return n;
}

// This uses fewer arithmetic operations than any other known implementation on machines with slow multiplication.
// It uses 17 arithmetic operations.
int hammingWeight(uint32_t n)
{
    n -= (n >> 1) & 0x55555555; //put count of each 2 bits into those 2 bits
    n = (n & 0x33333333) + (n >> 2 & 0x33333333); //put count of each 4 bits into those 4 bits
    n = (n + (n >> 4)) & 0x0F0F0F0F; //put count of each 8 bits into those 8 bits
    n += n >> 8; // put count of each 16 bits into those 8 bits
    n += n >> 16; // put count of each 32 bits into those 8 bits
    return n & 0xFF;
}

// This uses fewer arithmetic operations than any other known implementation on machines with fast multiplication.
// It uses 12 arithmetic operations, one of which is a multiply.
int hammingWeight(uint32_t n)
{
    n -= (n >> 1) & 0x55555555; // put count of each 2 bits into those 2 bits
    n = (n & 0x33333333) + (n >> 2 & 0x33333333); // put count of each 4 bits into those 4 bits
    n = (n + (n >> 4)) & 0x0F0F0F0F; // put count of each 8 bits into those 8 bits 
    return n * 0x01010101 >> 24; // returns left 8 bits of x + (x<<8) + (x<<16) + (x<<24)
}
