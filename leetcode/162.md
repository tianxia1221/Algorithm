# 162. Find Peak Element

> https://leetcode.com/problems/find-peak-element/

> A peak element is an element that is greater than its neighbors.
>
> Given an input array `nums`, where `nums[i] ≠ nums[i+1]`, find a peak element and return its index.
>
> The array may contain multiple peaks, in that case return the index to any one of the peaks is fine.
>
> You may imagine that `nums[-1] = nums[n] = -∞`.

## Approach 1 : 

```java
class Solution {
    public int findPeakElement(int[] nums) {
        int n = nums.length;
        for(int i=0; i<n; i++) {
            if(i+1 < n && nums[i] > nums[i+1])
                return i;
        }
        return n - 1;
    }
}
