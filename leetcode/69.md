# 69. Sqrt(x)

> https://leetcode.com/problems/sqrtx/

> Implement `int sqrt(int x)`.
>
> Compute and return the square root of *x*, where *x* is guaranteed to be a non-negative integer.
>
> Since the return type is an integer, the decimal digits are truncated and only the integer part of the result is returned.

## Approach 1 : 

```c
class Solution {
public:
    int mySqrt(int x) {
        int low = 0,  high = x, mid;
        if(x<=1) return x; 
        int y;
        while(low<high)
        {      
            mid = low +(high -low)/2;
            y = x/mid;
            if(y == mid) return mid;
            else if(y < mid) high = mid-1;
            else low = mid+1;
        }
        
        if(low*low > x) return low-1;
        else return low ;
    }
};
