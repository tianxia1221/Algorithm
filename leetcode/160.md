## Approach 1 : 

* A + C + B = B + C + A

```c++
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * struct ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode *next;
 *     ListNode(int x) : val(x), next(NULL) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    ListNode *getIntersectionNode(ListNode *headA, ListNode *headB) {
        
        ListNode *a = headA;
        ListNode *b = headB;

        
        if(!headA || !headB) {
            return NULL;
        }
        
       while( a != b){
        	//for the end of first iteration, we just reset the pointer to the head of another linkedlist
            a = a == NULL? headB : a->next;
            b = b == NULL? headA : b->next;    
        }
        return a; 
    }
};
