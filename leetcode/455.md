#  455. Assign Cookies

> https://leetcode.com/problems/assign-cookies/

> Assume you are an awesome parent and want to give your children some cookies. But, you should give each child at most one cookie. Each child i has a greed factor gi, which is the minimum size of a cookie that the child will be content with; and each cookie j has a size sj. If sj >= gi, we can assign the cookie j to the child i, and the child i will be content. Your goal is to maximize the number of your content children and output the maximum number.
>
> **Note:**
> You may assume the greed factor is always positive.
> You cannot assign more than one cookie to one child.

## Approach 1 : Greedy

```java
class Solution {
    public int findContentChildren(int[] g, int[] s) {
        Arrays.sort(g);
        Arrays.sort(s);
        int child = 0;
        int cookie = 0;
        while(child < g.length && cookie < s.length) {
            if(g[child] <= s[cookie]) child++;
            cookie++;
        }
        return child;
    }
}
```
